				If message is set all incoming e-mails will automatically generate
				responses. Informations about senders which received 
				generated response are stored for some time. So multiple
				incoming (in short period) messages from the same sender will
				generate only one response. Automatic responses are not send 
				on messages received from mailing lists.
