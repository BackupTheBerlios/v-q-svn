Version 2.2

Changes since Version 2.1
-------------------------

o Added support for MICO. Tested only on Unix.

o Added makefiles for GNU and BSD make. It's easier to compile sources under
  Unix. Chosing ORB implementation is done via P_USE_ORB environment variable.
  See Makefile.unix.inc.

Version 2.1

Changes since Version 2.0
-------------------------

o Support has been added for omniORB. Note that omniORB 4.0.3
  is required; the CORBA Utilities package will NOT compile with
  earlier versions of omniORB. Thanks for Duncan Grisby for his help
  with this port.

o Rather than having a separate PDF file for each utility, all the
  documentation has now been gathered into one book.

o A new Orbix-specific utility called "orbix_ns_on_fixed_port" has been
  added. This utility reconfigures the Naming Service so that it
  listens on a fixed port, which makes it firewall friendly.
  Documentation for this can be found in the "Orbix Administration Made
  Simple" chapter of the documentation.

o Some minor typos have been fixed in the documentation.



Version 2.0

Changes since Version 1.3.2
---------------------------

o A backwards-incompatible change has been made to the PoaUtility
  class. In older versions of this class, a boolean parameter was
  passed to the constructor. This boolean flag allowed one of two
  server deployment models to be used. The new version of the class
  allows any of four deployment models to be used. This has
  necessitated that the boolean parameter be replaced with an "enum"
  parameter in the C++ version, and an "int" parameter in the Java
  version (because Java does not have "enum" types). Read the
  "doc/PoaUtility.pdf" file for details of the new version of the
  PoaUtility class.

o Unnecessary (and hence slightly confusing) Makefile variables in the
  "Makefile.inc.<product>" files have been removed.



Version 1.3.2

Changes since Version 1.3.1
---------------------------

o Perry Russell added support for TAO (an open-source CORBA implementation).



Version 1.3.1

Changes since Version 1.3
-------------------------

o A new Orbix administration utility called "orbix_notify_service"
  is provided. This utility is documented in the "Orbix Administration
  Made Simple" paper (doc/orbix_admin.pdf).



Version 1.3

Changes since Version 1.2.3
---------------------------

o The documentation has been reformatted into a 12pt font (it used to
  be in 10pt). The PDF files are more compact and are hyperlinked. For
  example, clicking on an entry in the table of contents brings you to
  the relevant page of the document.

o No new software utilities have been added, but two new documents have
  been added:

	- "The corbaloc and corbaname URLs" document (doc/corbaloc.pdf)
	  provides an short, easy-to-understand discussion of the
	  "corbaloc:" and "corbaname:" URL formats for CORBA object
	  references.

	- The "Tips for Windows" document (doc/tips_for_windows.pdf)
	  provides 3 useful tips that can help people who use (MS-DOS)
	  command windows on a PC.



Version 1.2.3

Changes since Version 1.2.2
---------------------------

o Changed the implementation of the ImportExport functionality so that
  the functions do not make use of any static or instance variables.
  Instead, all the work is done with stack-local variables. This makes
  these functions thread-safe and also suitable for use in a multi-ORB
  application.



Version 1.2.2

Changes since Version 1.2.1
---------------------------

o In the "Orbix Administration Made Simple" paper, the discussion of
  the configuration variables for thread pools has been updated.



Version 1.2.1

Changes since Version 1.2
-------------------------

o ASP 6.0 has changed the integer value that is passed as a parameter to
  orb.create_policy() when associating a work queue with a POA. The
  source code of the PoaUtility class has been modified so that it
  works correctly with both ASP 6.0 and previous versions of ASP.



Version 1.2 

Changes since Version 1.1
-------------------------

o Fixed some typos in doc/import_export.pdf.

o Changed Makefile.inc.orbix to provide support for ASP 6.0



Version 1.1

Changes since the original (unnumbered version)
-----------------------------------------------

o The original version of CORBA Utilities package provided only
  C++ versions of the import/export and PoaUtility classes.
  This version also provides Java versions. Javadoc documentation
  is provided in the top-level "javadoc" directory.

o The C++ version of import/export has undergone some changes in
  its public API:

	- The import_obj_ref() function has been renamed to
	  corbautil::importObjRef()

	- The export_obj_ref() function has been renamed to
	  corbautil::exportObjRef()

	- The functions do not throw a std::string exception
	  if anything goes wrong. Instead, they now throw a
	  corbautil::ImportExportException.

o The C++ version of the POA hierarchy utility class has undergone
  some changes in its public API:

	- The class has been renamed from poa_hierarchy_base to
	  corbautil::PoaUtility

	- Operations on this class are no longer spelled in
	  lower_case_and_underscores(). Instead, they are spelled
	  in mixedCapitals().

	- If any errors occur in an operation on this class then
	  it does not throw a std::string exception. Instead, it
	  now throws a corbautil::PoaUtilityException.
