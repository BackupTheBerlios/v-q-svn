</author><info>CODE: added qmail_assign_add which adds line to qmail/users/assign
<br/>CODE: added qmail_assign_ex - program that checks whether domains is in qmail/users/assign
<br/>CODE: it decided that part changing qmail's files should be moved off cfsvq.cc to separate programs. One action for one program.
<br/>CODE: I'm also assuming that program modifing something in vq's directory has full rigths to do it (so it will try to copy permissions, owners, etc.)
<br/>BUG: file_rm: under gcc 2.95 didn't work - it couldn't create file to read (yes, it tried to create it, stupid idea)
<br/>BUG: file_rm: now it returns error code if it can't copy permissions and owners from original file
