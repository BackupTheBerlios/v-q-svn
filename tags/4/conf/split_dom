3

Level of splits of domain name. Directory "domains" includes domains
registered in system. It's possible to lower number of entries per 
directory by creating tree. If you leave this with value 3, path for
"test.org.pl" in "domains" will look: domains/pl/org/test/test.org.pl.
If you don't want any splits set it to 0.
