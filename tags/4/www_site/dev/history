CODE: contrib: removed install.{cc,h}, they are copied from main directory during make stage
CODE: there may be some aborts, please notify me (I'll try to check as much programs as possible)
CODE: optimization is turned on again, found that aborts were caused by wrong object order (g++ sucks?!) while linking
CODE: Makefile -> changed order in which objects are passed to g++ when linking install (bad order causes aborts when exception is thrown from hier). what the fuck is with g++?

author: new@localhost
CODE: added qmail_assign_add which adds line to qmail/users/assign
CODE: added qmail_assign_ex - program that checks whether domains is in qmail/users/assign
CODE: it decided that part changing qmail's files should be moved off cfsvq.cc to separate programs. One action for one program.
CODE: I'm also assuming that program modifing something in vq's directory has full rigths to do it (so it will try to copy permissions, owners, etc.)
BUG: file_rm: under gcc 2.95 didn't work - it couldn't create file to read (yes, it tried to create it, stupid idea)
BUG: file_rm: now it returns error code if it can't copy permissions and owners from original file

CODE: pgsqlauthd: moved from libpq++ to libpqxx.
CODE: moving from libpq++ to libpqxx.
