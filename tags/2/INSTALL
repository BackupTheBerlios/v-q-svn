First you need to install qmail (it's better to place it in /var/qmail),
you can download patch for qmail from http://iidea.pl/~paweln/proj/q-p/
(it's a special patch including most common needed stuff and also
specially created to support some features of vq).

Installing with PostgreSQL module.

Install PostgreSQL, create user and database for mail system, if you want
to use programs from contrib directory you should specify encoding for
table as utf-8, or you'll have to modify source code for that programs.

For more details see doc/pgsql directory, especially README file :-)

Step-by-step
-----------------------------
1. create group vq, create user vq in group vq.
2. create databases and tables (see doc/pgsql/README)
3. edit conf/* files, or copy current configuration to conf directory.
4. make
5. ./install
6. make /var/vq/lib searchable by ld (on Linux add this directory to 
/etc/ld.so.conf, on OpenBSD edit /etc/rc.conf, variable shlib_dirs)
7. that's it folks, you may use vq

Problems
-----------------------------
1. At this time gcc 3.2 is not supported, I don't run any system with it (I'm
using 2.95), I think there may be some problems with compiling it under
3.2 (especially namespaces), someone could try and report problems to me.
