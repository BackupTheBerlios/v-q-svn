<h2>HOWTO.maildirquota</h2>

<p>The remaining portion of this document is a technical description of the
maildir quota extension. This section is a brief overview of this
extension.</p>

<h3>What is a maildirquota?</h3>

<p>If you would like to have a quota on your maildir mailboxes, the best
solution is to always use filesystem-based quotas: per-user usage quotas that
is enforced by the operating system.</p>

<p>This is the best solution when the default Maildir is located in each
account's home directory. This solution will NOT work if Maildirs are stored
elsewhere, or if you have a large virtual domain setup where a single userid
is used to hold many individual Maildirs, one for each virtual user.</p>

<p>This extension to the maildir format allows a "voluntary" maildir quota
implementation that does not rely on filesystem-based quotas.</p>

<h3>When maildirquota will not work.</h3>

<p>For this quota mechanism to work, all software that accesses a maildir must
observe this quota protocol. It follows that this quota mechanism can be
easily circumvented if users have direct (shell) access to the filesystem
containing the users' maildirs.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this quota mechanism is not 100% effective. It is possible to
have a situation where someone may go over quota. This quota implementation
uses a deliverate trade-off. It is necessary to use some form of locking in
order to have a complete bulletproof quota enforcement, but maildirs mail
stores were explicitly designed to avoid any kind of locking. This quota
approach does not use locking, and the tradeoff is that sometimes it is
possible for a few extra messages to be delivered to the maildir, before the
door is permanently shot.</p>

<p>For best performance, all maildir clients should support this quota
extension, however there's a wide degree of tolerance here. As long as the
mail delivery agent that puts new messages into a Maildir uses this extension,
the quota will be enforced without excessive degradation.</p>

<p>In the worst case scenario, quotas are automatically recalculated every
fifteen minutes.  If a maildir goes over quota, and a mail client that does
not support this quota extension removes enough mail from the maildir, the
mail delivery agent will not be immediately informed that the maildir is now
under quota.  However, eventually the correct quota will be recalculated and
mail delivery will resume.</p>

<p>Mail user agents sometimes put messages into the maildir themselves.
Messages added to a maildir by a mail user agent that does not understand the
quota extension will not be immediately counted towards the overall quota, and
may not be counted for an extensive period of time. Additionally, if there are
a lot of messages that have been added to a maildir from these mail user
agents, quota recalculation may impose non-trivial load on the system, as the
quota recalculator will have to issue the stat system call for each
message.</p>

<h3>How to implement the quota</h3>

<p>The best way to do that is to modify your mail server to implement the
protocol defined by this document. Not everyone, of course, has this ability.
Therefore, an alternate approach is available.</p>

<p>This package creates a very short utility called "<tt>deliverquota</tt>".
It will NOT be installed anywhere by default, unless this maildir quota
implementation is a part of a larger package, in which case the parent package
may install this utility somewhere. If you obtained the maildir package
separately, you will need to compile it by running the <tt>configure</tt>
script, then by running <tt>make</tt>.</p>

<p><tt>deliverquota</tt> takes two arguments. <tt>deliverquota</tt> reads the
message from standard input, then delivers it to the maildir specified by the
first argument to <tt>deliverquota</tt>. The second argument specifies the
actual quota for this maildir, as defined elsewhere in this document.
<tt>deliverquota</tt> will deliver the message to the maildir, making a best
effort not to exceed the stated quota. If the maildir is over quota,
<tt>deliverquota</tt> terminates with exit code 77. Otherwise, it delivers the
message, updates the quota, and terminates with exit code 0.</p>

<p>Therefore, proceed as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Copy <tt>deliverquota</tt> to some convenient location, say
    <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt>.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Configure your mail server to use deliverquota. For example, if you use
    Qmail and your maildirs are all located in $HOME/Maildir, replace the
    '<tt>./Maildir/</tt>' argument to <tt>qmail-start</tt> with the
    following:<br>
    <br>

    <pre>'| /usr/local/bin/deliverquota ./Maildir 1000000S'</pre>
    <p><br>
    This sets a one million byte limit on all Maildirs. As I mentioned, this
    is meaningless if login access is available, because the individual
    account owner can create his own <tt>$HOME/.qmail</tt> file, and ignore
    deliverquota. Note that in this case, you MUST use apostrophes on the
    <tt>qmail-start</tt> command line, in order to quote this as one
    argument.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you would like to use different quotas for different users, you will
have to put together a separate process or a script that looks up the
appropriate quota for the recipient, and runs deliverquota specifying the
quota.  If no login access to the mail server is available, you can simply
create a separate <tt>$HOME/.qmail</tt> for every recipient.</p>

<p>That's pretty much it. If you handle a moderate amount of mail, I have one
more suggestion. For the first couple of weeks, run <tt>deliverquota</tt>
setting the second argument to an empty string. This disables quota
enforcement, however it still activates certain optimizations that permit very
fast quota recalculation. Messages delivered by <tt>deliverquota</tt> have
their message size encoded in their filename; this makes it possible to avoid
stat-ing the message in the Maildir, when recalculating the quota. Then, after
most messages in your maildirs have been delivered by <tt>deliverquota</tt>,
activate the quotas!!!</p>

<h3>maildirquota-enhanced applications</h3>

<p>This is a list of applications that have been enhanced to support the
maildirquota extension:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.flounder.net/%7Emrsam/maildrop/">maildrop</a> - mail
    delivery agent/mail filter.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.inter7.com/sqwebmail/">SqWebmail</a> - webmail CGI
    binary.</li>
</ul>

<p>These applications fall into two classes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mail delivery agents. These applications read some externally defined
    table of mail recipients and their maildir quota.</li>
  <li>Mail clients.  These applications read maildir quota information that
    has been defined by the mail delivery agent.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mail clients generally do not need any additional setup in order to use the
maildirquota extension. They will automatically read and implement any quota
specification set by the mail delivery agent.</p>

<p>On the other hand, mail delivery agents will require some kind of
configuration in order to activate the maildirquota extension for some or all
recipients. The instructions for doing that depends upon the mail delivery
agent. The documentation for the mail delivery agent should be consulted for
additional information.</p>

<h2>Mission statement</h2>
Maildir++ is a mail storage structure that's based on the Maildir structure,
first used in the Qmail mail server. Actually, Maildir++ is just a minor
extension to the standard Maildir structure.

<p>For more information, see <tt><a href="http://www.qmail.org/man/man5/maildir.html">http://www.qmail.org/man/man5/maildir.html</a></tt>.
I am not going to include the definition of a Maildir in this document.
Consider it included right here. This document only describes the
differences.</p>

<p>Maildir++ adds a couple of things to a standard Maildir: folders and
quotas.</p>

<p>Quotas enforce a maximum allowable size of a Maildir. In many situations,
using the quota mechanism of the underlying filesystem won't work very well.
If a filesystem quota mechanism is used, then when a Maildir goes over quota,
Qmail does not bounce additional mail, but keeps it queued, changing one bad
situation into another bad situation. Not only do you have an account that's
backed up, but now your queue starts to back up too.</p>

<h2>Definitions, and goals</h2>
Maildir++ and Maildir shall be completely interchangeable. A Maildir++ client
will be able to use a standard Maildir, automatically "upgrading" it in the
process. A Maildir client will be able to use a Maildir++ just like a regular
Maildir. Of course, a plain Maildir client won't be able to enforce a quota,
and won't be able to access messages stored in folders.

<p>Folders are created as subdirectories under the main Maildir. The name of
the subdirectory always starts with a period. For example, a folder named
"Important" will be a subdirectory called ".Important". You can't have
subdirectories that start with two periods.</p>

<p>A Maildir++ client ignores anything in the main Maildir that starts with a
period, but is not a subdirectory.</p>

<p>Each subdirectory is a fully-fledged Maildir of its own, that is you have
.Important/tmp, .Important/new, and .Important/cur. Everything that applies to
the main Maildir applies equally well to the subdirectory, including
automatically cleaning up old files in tmp. A Maildir++ enhancement is that a
message can be moved between folders and/or the main Maildir simply by
moving/renaming the file (into the cur subdirectory of the destination
folder). Therefore, the entire Maildir++ must reside on the same
filesystem.</p>

<p>Within each subdirectory there's an empty file, <tt>maildirfolder</tt>. Its
existence tells the mail delivery agent that this Maildir is a really a folder
underneath a parent Maildir++.</p>

<p>Only one special folder is reserved: Trash (subdirectory .Trash). Instead
of marking deleted messages with the D flag, Maildir++ clients move the
message into the Trash folder. Maildir++ readers are responsible for expunging
messages from Trash after a system-defined retention interval.</p>

<p>When a Maildir++ reader sees a message marked with a D flag it may at its
option: remove the message immediately, move it into Trash, or ignore it.</p>

<p>Can folders have subfolders, defined in a recursive fashion? The answer is
no. If you want to have a client with a hierarchy of folders, emulate it. Pick
a hierarchy separator character, say ":". Then, folder foo/bar is subdirectory
.foo:bar.</p>

<p>This is all that there's to say about folders. The rest of this document
deals with quotas.</p>

<p>The purpose of quotas is to temporarily disable a Maildir, if it goes over
the quota. There is one and only major goal that this quota implementation
tries to achieve:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Place as little overhead as possible on the mail system that's
    delivering to the Maildir++</li>
</ul>
That's it. To achieve that goal, certain compromises are made:
<ul>
  <li>Mail delivery will stop as soon as possible after Maildir++'s size goes
    over quota. Certain race conditions may happen with Maildir++ going a lot
    over quota, in rare circumstances. That is taken into account, and the
    situation will eventually resolve itself, but you should not simply take
    your systemwide quota, multiply it by the number of mail accounts, and
    allocate that much disk space. Always leave room to spare.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>How well the quota mechanism will work will depend on whether or not
    everything that accesses the Maildir++ is a Maildir++ client. You can have
    a transition period where some of your mail clients are just Maildir
    clients, and things should run more or less well. There will be some
    additional load because the size of the Maildir will be recalculated more
    often, but the additional load shouldn't be noticeable.</li>
</ul>
This won't be a perfect solution, but it will hopefully be good enough.
Maildirs are simply designed to rely on the filesystem to enforce individual
quotas. If a filesystem-based quota works for you, use it.

<p>A Maildir++ may contain the following additional file: maildirsize.</p>

<h2>Contents of <tt>maildirsize</tt></h2>

<p><tt>maildirsize</tt> contains two or more lines terminated by newline
characters.</p>

<p>The first line contains a copy of the quota definition as used by the
system's mail server. Each application that uses the maildir must know what
it's quota is. Instead of configuring each application with the quota logic,
and making sure that every application's quota definition for the same maildir
is exactly the same, the quota specification used by the system mail server is
saved as the first line of the <tt>maildirsize</tt> file. All other
application that enforce the maildir quota simply read the first line of
<tt>maildirsize</tt>.</p>

<p>The quota definition is a list, separate by commas. Each member of the list
consists of an integer followed by a letter, specifying the nature of the
quota. Currently defined quota types are 'S' - total size of all messages, and
'C' - the maximum count of messages in the maildir. For example,
10000000S,1000C specifies a quota of 10,000,000 bytes or 1,000 messages,
whichever comes first.</p>

<p>All remaining lines all contain two integers separated by a single space.
The first integer is interpreted as a byte count. The second integer is
interpreted as a file count. A Maildir++ writer can add up all byte counts and
file counts from <tt>maildirsize</tt> and enforce a quota based either on
number of messages or the total size of all the messages.</p>

<h2>Calculating <tt>maildirsize</tt></h2>

<p>In most cases, changes to <tt>maildirsize</tt> are recorded by appending an
additional line. Under some conditions <tt>maildirsize</tt> has to be
recalculated from scratch. These conditions are defined later. This is the
procedure that's used to recalculate <tt>maildirsize</tt>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If we find a <tt>maildirfolder</tt> within the directory, we're
    delivering to a folder, so back up to the parent directory, and start
    again.</li>
  <li>Read the contents of the new and cur subdirectories. Also, read the
    contents of the new and cur subdirectories in each Maildir++ folder,
    except Trash. Before reading each subdirectory, stat() the subdirectory
    itself, and keep track of the latest timestamp you get.</li>
  <li>If the filename of each message is of the form xxxxx,S=nnnnn or
    xxxxx,S=nnnnn:xxxxx where "xxxxx" represents arbitrary text, then use
    nnnnn as the size of the file (which will be conveniently recorded in the
    filename by a Maildir++ writer, within the conventions of filename naming
    in a Maildir). If the message was not written by a Maildir++ writer,
    stat() it to obtain the message size. If stat() fails, a race condition
    removed the file, so just ignore it and move on to the next one.</li>
  <li>When done, you have the grand total of the number of messages and their
    total size. Create a new maildirsize by: creating the file in the tmp
    subdirectory, observing the conventions for writing to a Maildir. Then
    rename the file as <tt>maildirsize</tt>.<tt></tt>Afterwards, stat all new
    and cur subdirectories again. If you find a timestamp later than the saved
    timestamp, REMOVE <tt>maildirsize</tt>.</li>
  <li>Before running this calculation procedure, the Maildir++ user wanted to
    know the size of the Maildir++, so return the calculated values. This is
    done even if <tt>maildirsize</tt> was removed.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Calculating the quota for a Maildir++</h2>

<p>This is the procedure for reading the contents of <tt>maildirsize</tt> for
the purpose of determine if the Maildir++ is over quota.</p>
<ol>
  <li>If <tt>maildirsize</tt> does not exist, or if its size is at least 5120
    bytes, recalculate it using the procedure defined above, and use the
    recalculated numbers. Otherwise, read the contents of maildirsize, and add
    up the totals.</li>
  <li>The most efficient way of doing this is to: open <tt>maildirsize</tt>,
    then start reading it into a 5120 byte buffer (some broken NFS
    implementations may return less than 5120 bytes read even before reaching
    the end of the file). If we fill it, which, in most cases, will happen
    with one read, close it, and run the recalculation procedure.</li>
  <li>In many cases the quota calculation is for the purpose of adding or
    removing messages from a Maildir++, so keep the file descriptor to
    <tt>maildirsize</tt> open. A file descriptor will not be available if
    quota recalculation ended up removing <tt>maildirsize</tt> due to a race
    condition, so the caller may or may not get a file descriptor together
    with the Maildir++ size.</li>
  <li>If the numbers we got indicated that the Maidlir++ is over quota, some
    additional logic is in order: if we did not recalculate
    <tt>maildirsize</tt>, if the numbers in <tt>maildirsize</tt> indicated
    that we are over quota, then if <tt>maildirsize</tt> was more than one
    line long, or if the timestamp on <tt>maildirsize</tt> indicated that it's
    at least 15 minutes old, throw out the totals, and recalculate
    <tt>maildirsize</tt> from scratch.</li>
</ol>

<p>Eventually the 5120 byte limitation will always cause maildirsize to be
recalculated, which will compensate for any race conditions which previously
threw off the totals. Each time a message is delivered or removed from a
Maildir++, one line is added to maildirsize (this is described below in
greater detail). Most messages are less than 10K long, so each line appended
to maildirsize will be either between seven and nine bytes long (four bytes
for message count, space, digit 1, newline, optional minus sign in front of
both counts if the message was removed). This results in about 640 Maildir++
operations before a recalculation is forced. Since most messages are added
once and removed once from a Maildir, expect recalculation to happen
approximately every 320 messages, keeping the overhead of a recalculation to a
minimum. Even if most messages include large attachments, most attachments are
less than 100K long, which brings down the average recalculation frequency to
about 150 messages.</p>

<p>Also, the effect of having non-Maildir++ clients accessing the Maildir++ is
reduced by forcing a recalculation when we're potentially over quota.  Even if
non-Maildir++ clients are used to remove messages from the Maildir, the fact
that the Maildir++ is still over quota will be verified every 15 minutes.</p>

<h2>Delivering to a Maildir++</h2>

<p>Delivering to a Maildir++ is like delivering to a Maildir, with the
following exceptions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Follow the usual Maildir conventions for naming the filename used to
    store the message, except that append ,S=nnnnn to the name of the file,
    where nnnnn is the size of the file. This eliminates the need to stat()
    most messages when calculating the quota. If the size of the message is
    not known at the beginning, append ,S=nnnnn when renaming the message from
    tmp to new.</li>
  <li>As soon as the size of the message is known (hopefully before it is
    written into tmp), calculate Maildir++'s quota, using the procedure
    defined previously. If the message is over quota, back out, cleaning up
    anything that was created in tmp.</li>
  <li>If a file descriptor to <tt>maildirsize</tt> was opened for us, after
    moving the file from tmp to new append a line to the file containing the
    message size, and "1".</li>
</ol>

<h2>Reading from a Maildir++</h2>

<p>Maildir++ readers should mind the following additional tasks:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure to create the <tt>maildirfolder</tt> file in any new folders
    created within the Maildir++.</li>
  <li>When moving a message to the Trash folder, append a line to maildirsize,
    containing a negative message size and a '-1'.</li>
  <li>When moving a message from the Trash folder, follow the steps described
    in "Delivering to Maildir++", as far as quota logic goes. That is, refuse
    to move messages out of Trash if the Maildir++ is over quota.</li>
  <li>Moving a message between other folders carries no additional
    requirements.</li>
</ol>
