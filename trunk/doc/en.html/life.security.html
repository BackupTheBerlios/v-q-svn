	It's also very important for me. That's way I performed some steps

><P
>&#13;		From the beginning v-q is developed using C++ and Standard Template
		Library. I try not to reinvent wheel, when possible I use 
		known and checked software. STL and C++ include common
		algorithms and data structures which have been checked by many
		developers.
		</P
><P
>&#13;		I try to keep this code as simple as possible, don't use any
		obfuscation techniques :-) It's simple in design, it's coded
		in a simple way. I try to maintain decent comments in code but
		I think that simpler code is better that larger documentation.
		</P
><P
>&#13;		I use automates to create code. For example I decided to use
		CORBA because it automates creation of communication protocol
		between daemons.
		</P
><P
>&#13;		From version 5 I started creating and performing unit testing as
		often as I can. For every bug found I create test before I fix
		it, that way I prevent it to be introduced again in next version.
		</P
><P
>&#13;		The most important thing I do to make this system stable
		and secure is using it on my own servers.

>3.2.2. Limiting access to sockets</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;		One of the steps that can be performed to secure system is to
		limit access to sockets used by daemons during communication.
		</P
><P
>&#13;		Directory <TT
CLASS="filename"
>contrib/service</TT
> includes sample
		scripts to run daemons under <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>daemontools</SPAN
> 
		(see <A
HREF="http://cr.yp.to"
TARGET="_top"
>http://cr.yp.to</A
> for
		informations about package). As you can see all daemons are
		executed with:
</P><PRE
CLASS="screen"
><TT
CLASS="userinput"
><B
>-ORBIIOPAddr "unix:/var/vq/sockets/$PROG.sock"</B
></TT
></PRE
><P>
		This argument tells CORBA implementation to use Unix sockets
		as a communication channel. Unix sockets are stored in
		a file system so you can limit access i.e. using 
		<SPAN
CLASS="application"
>chmod</SPAN
>. Use
</P><PRE
CLASS="screen"
><TT
CLASS="userinput"
><B
>chmod 700 /var/vq/sockets</B
></TT
></PRE
><P>
		to limit access only to all processes run by owner of 
		<TT
CLASS="filename"
>/var/vq/sockets</TT
> directory.
		</P
><P
>&#13;		If you want to allow processes run by different users to access
		daemons it's advised to create special group which will have
		access to Unix sockets and run all those processes with this
		group.
