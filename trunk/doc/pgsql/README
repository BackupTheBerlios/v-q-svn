Files in current directory includes procedures and tables used by pgsqllogd,
pgsqlauthd, they must be created in PostgreSQL database before using
these programs.

Instalation
----------------------------

First create database, it's advised to set encoding to unicode, for
example:

# createdb -Upgsql -Eunicode mail

where pgsql is user allowed to create databases.

Create vq system user called mail:

# createuser -P -Upgsql mail

You will be prompted for password for user mail, then pgsql.

Now you can import database, you can do it using psql program, log in
as mail or pgsql, you're current database should be mail, write

# \i db.sql

You'll be asked for pgsql user password (in my case it's PostgreSQL admin) -
- language plpgsql will be created. After you'll be asked for mail user
password, tables will be created.

After this you should import functions from other .sql files.

At the end you should have database prepared for use by vq.
