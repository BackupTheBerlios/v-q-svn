		<title>Reporting bugs</title>

		<para>
			As all software in the world this one has also bugs.
			I try my best to lowerage number of them. But as with
			all bugs it's hard to kill them all. So if you find any 
			please notify me.
		</para>

		<para>
			If you find a bug please try to reproduce it. Reproducing
			a bug means a lot about it and helps developers to remove
			it ASAP. But if you're not able to reproduce it also
			please give us a message about it.
		</para>

		<para>
			Project maintains public bug list which is available on
			SourceForge under following URL 
			<ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=87916&amp;atid=584853">http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=87916&amp;atid=584853</ulink>.
			Anyone is allowed to insert entries into it. So if you find a bug
			go straigth to this page and write all informations that
			you think could help.
		</para>

		<para>
			Informations you should include in a bug report:
			v-q's version, architecture, operating system, 
			error description, messages printed by program, 
			configuration (except passwords of course :-), 
			action description. And of course if you can reproduce it
			please write all actions to do it.
		</para>

		<para>
			If you can please write a test case for a bug and send
			us a patch. It will mean a lot for us.

			<para>
				Don't know what to put here. I have an 
				<ulink url="http://new.foo-baz.com/me/cv.html">online CV</ulink>
				where you can read about my work experience. 
				I also run <ulink url="http://new.foo-baz.com">a blog</ulink>

			<para>
				In short I'm an Unix guy which loves creating good
				applications. I work as a developer and manager of a
				programming division. I live in a small city called
				Koszalin in Poland. I try to run small company
				called <ulink url="http://foo-baz.com">foo-baz.com</ulink>.
				At this time my only product is my knowledge about
				v-q, qmail, apache, Linux, OpenBSD and databases. May be some
				day it will make foo-baz.com a profitable company :-)
