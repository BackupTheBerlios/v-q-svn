		Watch out! Format of logging tables was changed. Also plpgsql
		function dom_add was changed, dom_log_add was added. To upgrade your
		system do following steps (if this list is not accurate please notify
		me):
		<ol>
			<li>
				Install libpqxx (use the newest package available).
			</li>
			<li>
				Install Sablotron, at least version 1.0. It will compile
				with older versions but won't work properly.
			</li>
			<li>
				Do backup of your all files!!! Especially database.
			</li>
			<li>
				cd docs/pgsql
			</li>
			<li>
				Drop your old version of dom_add (DROP FUNCTION dom_add(text)).
				Following command will not drop it (new function is dom_add(text,text)).
			</li>
			<li>
				psql -Umail &lt; dom_add.sql
			</li>
			<li>
				psql -Umail &lt; dom_log_add.sql
			</li>
			<li>
				Run psql, drop *_log tables and recreate them with dom_log_add.
				Drop log table, recreate it using log.sql file.
			</li>
			<li>
				Install new software and test your system. Remember that
				programs from contrib may not be compatible with new
				version so you need to upgrade them also.
			</li>
		</ol>
