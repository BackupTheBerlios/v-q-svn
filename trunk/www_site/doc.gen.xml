	<title>Generating documentation</title>

	<para>
		This chapter describes how to process DocBook XML documentation
		into other formats such as: HTML, RTF.
	</para>

	<section>
		<title>OpenBSD</title>

		<para>
			First you need install openjade and dockbook-* packages.
			This packages allows you to process SGML documents into
			some formats. Sadly (as in 3.6 release) there is no
			package with DocBook XML style-sheets so you need to
			download appropriate.
		</para>

		<para>
			I used files from Fedora Core 2 release (packages: 
			docbook-style-dsssl-1.78-2.noarch.rpm
			and docbook-dtds-1.0-22.1.noarch.rpm). I unpacked them
			with <command>rpm2cpio</command>, copied everything from 
			usr/share/ to /usr/local/share/sgml/redhat. Then
			added following lines:
			<screen>
				CATALOG "redhat/sgml/docbook/xml-dtd-4.1.2-1.0-22.1/catalog"
				CATALOG "redhat/sgml/docbook/xml-dtd-4.2-1.0-22.1/catalog"
				CATALOG "redhat/sgml/docbook/dsssl-stylesheets/catalog" 
			</screen>
			to /usr/local/share/sgml/catalog.
		</para>

		<para>
			Then using following command I was able to create RTF version of
			documentation:
			<command>env SGML_CATALOG_FILES=/usr/local/share/sgml/catalog 
			openjade -t rtf -d 
			/usr/local/share/sgml/docbook/dsssl/modular/html/docbook.dsl 
			/usr/local/share/sgml/docbook/dsssl/modular/dtds/decls/xml.dcl ../index.xml
			</command>. Changing RTF to SGML produces HTML files.

			<note>
				<para>
					<command>openjade</command> may print warnings
					about DTDDECL which is not supported but you
					should ignore them.
				</para>
			</note>
		</para>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>Using makefile</title>

		<para>
			After installing openjade and docbook files all you need
			to do is run make.
		</para>

		<para>
			There are few targets producing documentation:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>doc-html produces HTML files in BASE/doc/html</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>doc-rtf produces RTF files in BASE/doc/rtf</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		</para>
