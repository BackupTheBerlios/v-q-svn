There are two possible ways to configure programs - at build or run time. All configuration
can be done before compiling. Almost all values can be changed after
compilation. The most important thing set on compile time is a home directory.
This option can be set only before compilation. And if you change it
you must recompile programs.

During installation all configuration file are copied to 
[home]/etc/[project_name]/conf (values in [] depends on project),
so you can easily check what values are compiled into programs. Usually
configuration files have description inside, if so only the first line of
file is a value.

<p>
If you want to change some value you need to create file in 
[home]/etc/[project_name]/. Name of file is the same as in conf directory.

<p>
I suggest to set all non changing data at compile time (except passwords,
which should not be compiled in for security reasons).
