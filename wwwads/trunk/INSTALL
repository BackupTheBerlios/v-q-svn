At this time there's no install rule in Makefile, probably there won't
be any.

To install this software do following steps:
* edit conf-* files. they are described, so you shouldn't have problems.
* run gmake, don't use BSD make.
* now copy files: wwwads, wwwads-conf to your CGI directory.
* run adsd
* test everything

It should work for you. If you have any questions, bugs, ideas contact me,
address is in README file.
