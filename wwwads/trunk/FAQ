* why advertisement and groups are not removed from WWWDIR ?
because of pages' caching, etc. i think it should be possible to
get image and url after some time after downloading page's source, it's
administrator's decision after what time. if ad. is removed file aid.rm
is created, if group is removed file rm is created in group's directory.
now you can write script to delete them after specified time (day,week,...).
