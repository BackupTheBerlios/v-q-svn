this module allows to administrate www aliases (at this time apache only
with virtualdocumentroot), information are stored in pgsql and filesystem
(only links to specified directiores). it allows you to easily create
subdomains for specified virtual host. it specially written for some
server, but it should be easily extensible to change sql server, 
directiory structure or whatever you want. i will accept any suggestions,
bug, and etc.

if you're interested in this module I can send you database structure
and other informations needed to set it up.

situation
----------------------------
I maintain hosting system, every domain administrator is allowed
to add users to its domain, remove them, configure dns aliases (sub-domains),
specify users which are allowed to access some parts of www site (for
example administrator can create sub-domain maintained by some user).
Each users allowed to change www site can view statistics about his/her
sub-domain, administrator can view all statistics.

modules
----------------------------
cftpmod.cc - lists all users in a given sub-domain, allows to assign
users it's www site directory (only one directory per user)

cuseraddmod.cc - allows to add user to domain, calls special program sending
notification to host admin and domain admin.

cusersmod.cc - shows all users, allows to operate on users' accounts (at 
this time only delete), shows some information about users.

cwwwalimod.cc - allows to administrate dns aliases.

cwwwstatmod.cc - allows to view statistic.
