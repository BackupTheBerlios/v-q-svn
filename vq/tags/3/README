Virtual Qmail
---------------------------------------------------
Project goal is to create virtual domains managing system, it should
be easy to setup, create and maintain. It should be also very reliable and
fast - it's designed for big sites. It does not support real users and
it won't. 

What vq won't do at any time in the future: 
----------------------------------------------------
* support POP3 authorization based relaying as vpopmail does - use SMTP-AUTH!
* support real users
* support any other mailboxes type than Maildir

Current futures:
-----------------------------------------------------
* PostgreSQL based authorization
* PostgreSQL based logging of user's authorizations

If you think that some future is missing you're welcome to add it or
if you can't but think it should be implemented you can contact author.
